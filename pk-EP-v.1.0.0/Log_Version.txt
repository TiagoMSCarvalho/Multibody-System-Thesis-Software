Version Log:
- Euler Parameters Updated;
- Read inputs with points;
- Fsolver doesn't find a solution;
- Position,Velocity and Acceleration Equations Updates;
- 3 New Excels were created:
	- suspension_fst10e:
		- Tries to solve the issue with the one wheel file, exchanges 2 sph on the chassis side  by 1 revolute to solve the overconstrain problem,
		however the results are not satisfatory.
	- one wheel:
		- Reduces the probelm to 1 wheel (Lower Sus), it is overconstrained by 2 dofs ( I suspect by the 2 spherical in each a-arm).
	- original:
		- Keeps the data as given by the team, it has several issues with non perpendicular axis and i overconstrained.
