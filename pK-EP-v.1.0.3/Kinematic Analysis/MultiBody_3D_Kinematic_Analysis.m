%Inputs and Outputs:
%    - Bodies: all the information of the MultiBody System
%    - NBodies: number of bodies in the MultiBody System
%    - Joints: structure with all the information relative to the joints
%    and constraints divided in fields correspondent to each type of
%    joint/constraint
%    -Points: Points previously attained
%    -t: time in seconds [s]
%    -nIteration: number of the iteration

% Objective of the Function:
%    This function's objective is to to call the funtions that compute the
%    points, then updating their position
